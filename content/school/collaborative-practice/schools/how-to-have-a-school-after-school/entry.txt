Posttext: 

One of the main lessons from my Master's I picked up overhearing a mentor coaching a friend:
> "To do a good project, think of a good project you did before and recreate the circumstances."

Being graduated and trying to do good projects again, it seems as if those circumstances were – at least in part – the school itself. I'm free now from all its burdens and expectations, but is that more free? Compared to the mental and emotional effort to get myself to work on something for half a day, it seems I was more free to do good projects in school.

Even though this intuition is inevitably coloured by a romantic bias on memorized events and a yearning for an easy solution, I do believe there's something to be found in analysing the circumstances of the school, and trying to see how those circumstances can be recreated now (without paying tuition). Can Extra Practice foster collective practice by modeling itself after a school? In other words, how to have a school after school?

Some questions:
	•	What exactly am I aiming for?
	•	What are relevant circumstances of the school?
	•	What circumstances can be recreated?
	•	What circumstances are hard to recreate?
	•	More in detail, what are circumstances I like to work in? [Tour de force vs Grand Tour]
	•	What can I find in the history of the school?
	•	What did I learn from coordinating a MA program?
